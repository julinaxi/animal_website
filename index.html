    <h2>Why Should we care about Animal Cruelty?</h2>
    <p>All animal cruelty is a concern because it is wrong to inflict suffering on any living creature. Intentional cruelty is a particular concern because it is a sign of psychological distress and often indicates that an individual either has already been a victim of violence or might be predisposed to committing acts of violence. There are many reasons why people are cruel to animals. One of the reasons is because a person feels powerless, unnoticed or under the control of others. The motive may be to shock, threaten, intimidate or offend others or to demonstrate rejection of society's rules. Those who are cruel to animals copy acts they have seen or that have been done to them. </p>
