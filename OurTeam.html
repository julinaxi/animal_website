    <h3> Our team puts in 100% effort into helping and caring for animals. </h3>
    <h2> WE WORK TO:
        End the cruelest practices toward all animals.
        Care for animals in crisis.
        Build a stronger animal protection movement.</h2>
    <h3>The more people we can gather would be great to help us suceed to our mission. We welcome and respect our volunteers' unique identities, diverse backgrounds and experiences to build an inclusive animal welfare movement. We believe everyone can help fight for all animals!</h3>
    <h3>What I can do to help Stop Animal Cruelty? </h3> 
    <p>-<b>Educate</b> those around you about animal abuse. </p>
    
    <p>-<b>Report</b> any incidents of abuse to your local animal control or dial 911, all incident reports legally need investigating.</p>

    <p>-Avoid using products from companies that are known for animal testing and <b>always research where your products come from</b>.</p>

    <p>-Donate financially or with personal time to humane animal shelters and organizations in your area. Any <b>Donation</b> would go towards the animals and supplies that we would need to use for the animals. </p>
    
    <p>-Come and <b>Volunteer</b> with us. By Volunteering with us you can work with animals that are in need of help or you can help at our building by keeping things in order and organized.  </p>
